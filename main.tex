\chapter*{Abstract}
In this thesis the extensive study of possible and surly optimal materials for Quantum Dot Solar Cells (QDSCs) will be provided to the reader. One will have the opportunity to develop a rather current image of the necessary parts in their architecture which will be supported with an abundant description of the important aspects in engineering a photovoltaic device. With an introduction of its kind we will try to convey a basic but sufficient knowledge of standard terms, light with matter interaction, light spectrum analysis, quantum dots description with their behaviour and a photovoltaic device operation theory with certainly needed quantities that one has to find in order to properly describe a solar cell. In many parts we will try to outline possible enlargement of that information. With the objective of creating a possibly competitive QDSC the description of methods that we used will be included with a related to them characteristics. One will also be able to use this paper as a review of todayâ€™s development phase and current technological state of the other scientific groups all around the world.  After a successful development of a solar cell, the analysis and comparison will definitely be provided.
