\chapter{Theory}

With this chapter the introduction of some theoretical concepts will be provided. Certainly some of chapters below could be omitted without missing the final result and its meaning. Nevertheless, even if the paper is laced with rather practical analysis and effects, a physicist should be sure to understand the aspects of an experiment well, not just to have a better insight into the outcome but also to be sure that during the process no foolish mistakes are made and to be able to find new methods to improve the research. Therefore, few parts will just be a reminder and introduction to notation used or to ensure the understanding and some will be treated as an inquiry of what might be searched to describe it further.
